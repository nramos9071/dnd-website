                <h1>Session 1</h1>
                <P>
                    I met Arc as he journeyed through the woods. We saw a ship crash in the distance and decided to check for survivors and/or threats.

There were dead Xaraxian guards & Barrork was fighting a Goliath. We decided to jump in and help. Arc turned into a fucking spider!

After the threat was eliminated we investigated a sphinx with a skull & book in its hands. It was rigged to kill anyone who tried to take the stuff with lightning damage, but we found a way using sticks to push it all off. We touched the stuff and we were transported to wildspace outside of Toril. We saw a group of people floating/standing over a person kneeling.

Barrork walked closer to the group to listen. Caiphon is the one kneeling. People around him are asking him to repent for something he’s done in order for power. Caiphon wanted mortals to worship him and the others as gods. They bind Caiphon to the mortal world (Toril) to be judged. They all begin to chant, except for one female named Gibith, but she eventually joins in. Caiphon stretched and pinned down to Toril.

We suddenly returned to the temple. The skull speaks to us, saying he is Mimir and here to help us decide Caiphpon’s judgement.

                </P>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Session 2</h1>
                <p>We long-rested at the temple and decided to head back to Mathieu. Went to the docks and met Sartell who runs the docks. Told her we’d help Mathieu with its bandit problem amongst other things.

                    We met Mayor Vanxath Loracys. We killed some bandits that came to town while meeting with her. We saw a Cleric/Preacher guy badmouthing Vanxath: Possible competitor. Arc also campaigned for mayorship ang got off to a “meh” start. We travelled into the forest to find the bandit hideout, but instead we found 3 Dragons in the Forest!
                    
                    Barrork attempted to talk to them, but was attacked. So we ran and they didn’t chase us. Maybe they're guarding something? Arc asked the nature around the area but they didn't know shit. We decided to go back to Mathieu.
                    </p>
                    
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Session 3</h1>
                <p>Just outside of Mathieu we robbed a potion maker who was leaving the town.
                <ul>
                        <li>2x Potion of Preservation</li>
                        <li>Potion of Arcana</li>
                        <li>Potion of Exp.</li>
                        <li>Potion of Darkvision</li>
                        <li>Potion of Anti-Paralyzation</li>
                        <li>Potion of Medicine</li>
                        <li>Potion of Nightmares</li>
                </ul>
                Right when we entered Mathieu there was the start of another attack on the city by bandits, but they seemed to have some help (Enforcers). We jumped in to fight. During the fight there were these dudes popping out of the corners and stealing our kills and talking shit. We think the attack was a set up by the Cleric/Preacher dude and the dudes stealing our kills were meant to make us look weak. We didn't kill all the Enforcers, since they fled, but left maybe 1 alive?
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Session 4</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hypo Kryt gets applause from townsfolk. He worships Cyric - Trickster god.</li>
                    <li>Goblin girl has dirt on him - go to Wet Cat for more info.</li>
                    <li>Tavern - Efficient Fish </li>
                    <li>Wet Cat - Madam Levin. Tilra (missing girl) was the pastor's main girl. Feared Dead. </li>
                    <li>Checked Tilra’s room. Found love letters signed by H (Hypo Kryt)</li>
                    <li>Barrork & Arc went to the tavern and ran into Jyll & Corvum. Jyll is still scarred from her kidnapping. </li>
                    <li>Corvum proposed a bank heist opportunity to Barrork.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
             <li>
                <h1>Session 5</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Completed campfire story for Jerry</li>
                    <li>Ran into Parker Quinn who was trying to sell a charge card</li>
                    <li>Jerry forced Parker to drop the card and stole it from him.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
             <li>
                <h1>Session 6</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>We wrapped up my campfire story about slaughtering the orphanage. We continued on our way
                        to Baldur’s gate. We ran into a “salesman” selling credit cards. We used magic to have him
                        drop one of the cards.</li>
                    <li>We enter Baldur’s Gate. Protestors are active against tariffs at one tall walled building 
                        (Royal Palace). Lots of districts: market, entertainment, finance, etc… Flyers on 
                        bulletins: Battlemania!</li>
                    <li>Stopped at the Solid Snake inn. Got some drinks & made some money playing music. A book nerd 
                        named Illonis Smith told us of a legendary armor used when defeating 5 dragons that he’s 
                        researching (Gerald). There’s a cave in a town called “raven” that may have some of the armor.</li>
                    <li>Barrork thinks there’s correlation between the 5 dragons and the 3 we ran into. Compares it to a
                         legend from his homeworld. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Session 7</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>We joined the Battlemania and placed bets on ourselves and walked out promised 90,000 gold. </li>
                    <li>Vince gave us 6,000 gold up front and told us to go to the First Bank of Baldur’s Gate for the other 85,000.</li>
                    <li>We’re invited to the event in Neverwinter.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Session 8-11?</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>We were robbed by a teleporting bandit. </li>
                    <li>We also went shopping & I’m owed a Greataxe in 3 days. We were told of Dragon Scales from a leftover battle in Phandalin. 
                    <li>We questioned Vince to see if he had something to do with us getting robbed.</li>
                    <li>We decided to go to Phandalin and find these dragon scales. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Notes from Previous Sessions to Now</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>When reaching phandalin, we were made aware of the heroes of phandalin. A tiefling, a loxadon, a half orc, and 2 elves.</li>
                    <li>The Villagers pointed the party to ice spire peak. While there Mirmir became active of another temple</li>
                    <li>While searching the fort, the party discovered an upper room. Here, outside of a window, the party saw stone eyes looking back at them.
                        When investigating, they saw a statue looking inside the room. Outside was the decaying body of an ice dragon </li>
                    <li>While trying to get the scales from the dragon, the statue glowed purple and the statue came to life. The statue was of Harbin Westor, the previous 
                        mayor of Phandlain. He was attacked by the heroes of Phandalin and turned to stone. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Upon seeing that this party was harvesting scales from the Cryovain, Harbin began attacking the party.</li>
                    <li>The party was able to defeat Harbin. Harbin pleaded for his life, stating that he just wanted to go back to his life. The party agreed to let him go.</li>
                    <li>Afterwards, the party searched the fort furhter and found a door that led to the temple.</li>
                    <li>The party found the portal in the temple and saw a vision of Caiphon questioning whether the mortals deserved their help.</li>
                    <li>As the party left the fort, they saw a smoke in the distance.</li>
                    <li>The party went to investigate and saw that not only had Harbin Westor began to destroy Phandalin, Caiphon was and his minions were also there fighting.</li>
                    <li>Caiphon easily dispatched the party, but after attacking appeared to have been struggling.</li>
                    <li>Caiphon exited with some of his minions and left Harbin Westor to fight the rest.</li>
                    <li>Caiphon instructed Barabbas to destroy the Druid camp of Arc's people.</li>
                    <li>The Party was able to finish of Harbin and raced towards the camp.</li>
                    <li>After traveling without any rest, the party made it to the Druid camp. The Camp was completely decimated. A ship believed to be Barabbas appeared to be
                        straffing the camp. During the fight, resistance fighters were dispatched to help secure the Druid Camp from the Xaraxyians. Once Barrork was recognized, the 
                        resistance fighers took his orders. The Resistance fighters also brought fighter Dameselflies to fight the Xaraxyian Wasp in the air. As they tried to get near the 
                        ssettlement, Mirmir began to react to the portals. 
                    </li>
                    <li>The Party fought there way to the settlement where they found Watson, the leader of the druids, beaten and tortured. Xegeles, the person torturing Watson
                        appeared to have been asking where the rest of the druids went.
                    </li>
                    <li>In his last act, he sacrificed his life to give the party the mana and rest they needed to defeat the enemy. His last words to his friend Arc
                        was, "Save them..."
                    </li>
                    <li>As the party was getting ready to find the remaining Druids, a resistance Dameselfly shot down the ship that was believed to be Barabbas.</li>
                    <li>The party decided to look for Barabbas first. When they found the ship, it was downed with the Dameselfly that shot it down in the distance. As the party approached
                        it was discovered that the bodies in the ship were the resistance pilots and it was a trap. Barabbas tried to lead a sneak attack on the party but failed. He was killed
                        by Barrork. Barrork found a knife and a coin sized button on Barabbas. A tear formed on Barabbas's eye as he faded away.  </li>
                    <li>The Party went to look for the remaining Druids. They found a cave that Arc knew was the Druid's Retreat. The Party investigated the cave.</li>
                    <li>Barrork found a sword that, when he touched it, surged a powerful energy through his body. </li>
                    <li>The party found a path with bodies laid across. Some of the bodies appeared to be fresh. Some were Xaraxyians and some were the resistance fighters that were helping earlier.
                         They also found a a shelf carved into the wall of the cave. Footsteps appeared to be going in and out from the wall with the shelf
                        The shelf had the words, "Red, Blue, and White" carved into it. In the center of the room was a table with shapes of gems carved in them. On the floor were 3 gems
                        cut in the shape of a ruby, sapphire, and diamond. The party tried putting the gems into the shelf corresponding with the colors of the gems but instead of a door 
                        opening, a light a appeared and the bodies that were on the ground becan to rise as undead.
                    </li>
                    <li>After defeating the undead, Arc decided to use stone shape to reform the cave wall which revealed a hidden room behind the wall. The room was silent.</li>
                    <li>When opening the wall, the undead again began to rise. But only the ones that were bathed in the light. The party defeated the ones that were still up and
                        manuvered around the light to enter the cave. Once in, they found that all the druids that had escaped were killed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Arc, stricken with grief, closed the room that Druids were in and buried them in the cave.</li>
                    <li>The party went back up to the settlement and approached a large rock that the Druids revered. Mirmir began to glow as they approached the rock. The party once again used Mirmir
                        to use the portal. They saw a vision of Caiphon walking with Gibbeth. The two talked about whether mortals deserved their help. Caiphon talked about ruling the mortals while
                        Gibbeth felt that they should be treated as precious. The two began to flirt until they were interrupted by the god Hadar. The Vision ends.
                    </li>
                    <li>The party destroys the portal like the others and heads towards baldur's gate. They find that baldur's gate has become extremely restrictive of people coming and going.
                        The party uses Jerry's connection to Baldur's Gate and to the Church of Torm as a way to get in. Once in, they discover that the city is being heavily restricted. Arc's description
                        is being posted around as someone of interest in the murder of a pastor of the church of Cyric. 
                    </li>
                    <li>The party went to the market to try and get their weapons made. They discovered that they were short the requisite scales to make the axe jerry wanted. But they were able to make 
                        Arc's armor. Instead the party settled for a long sword with the scales they had, and Jerry commissioned a great axe for his troubles. 
                    </li>
                    <li>The party makes their way to the cathedral of Torm where Jerry's mentor Polka resides. Polka assists the party with giving Barrork temporary status as a convert. In doing so,
                        the connection to Hoar he had was lost and the hand of retribution no longer resonated with holy energy.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once papers were secured, the party decided to leave. However, it was close to night time and an anti magic field shimmered across Baldur's gate. The people of Baldur's gate explained
                        that the anti magic field directly targeted teleportation spells. The party decided to rest at the inn in Baldur's gate.
                    </li>
                    <li>While at the Inn, the party saw Illinois Smith again. He commissioned the party to transport a sword that is a relic of the planet Gerald. The party agreed to the terms of the deal. They were
                        to meet Ross at the muesuem in the morning. 
                    </li>
                    <li>While attempting to transport the sword, the bandit from before appeared and stole the sword from the muesuem. After some chase, the bandit made his way to the sewers of 
                        Baldur's gate. The party chased him down the sewers. </li>
                    <li>While searching the sewers, the party found a group of immigrants hiding from the knights above. The party questioned the immigrants but Arc decided to bring attention to 
                        the group. Some knights on patrol stormed down the sewers and began to attack. The party defended the immigrants long enough that they were able to retreat deeper into the sewers.
                    </li>
                    <li>The party was left fighting off the knights. After some time, the knights began to surround the room the immigrants were in. The party tried to fight their way out. Arc lit the room 
                        on fire and Arc and Barrrok made a break up the stairs where more Knights were coming down. Jerry had appeared to give up. 
                    </li>
