                        the level of help the Elders gods were giving them. Gibbeth believed that mortals should have to work for their help, while Caiphon believed that mortals were nothing more than
                        mere subjects to be toyed with. The conversation moved towards flirting. Before anything progressed, the moment was disturbed by Hadar.
