                <h1>Session 1</h1>
                <P>
                    I met Arc as he journeyed through the woods. We saw a ship crash in the distance and decided to check for survivors and/or threats.

There were dead Xaraxian guards & Barrork was fighting a Goliath. We decided to jump in and help. Arc turned into a fucking spider!

After the threat was eliminated we investigated a sphinx with a skull & book in its hands. It was rigged to kill anyone who tried to take the stuff with lightning damage, but we found a way using sticks to push it all off. We touched the stuff and we were transported to wildspace outside of Toril. We saw a group of people floating/standing over a person kneeling.

Barrork walked closer to the group to listen. Caiphon is the one kneeling. People around him are asking him to repent for something he’s done in order for power. Caiphon wanted mortals to worship him and the others as gods. They bind Caiphon to the mortal world (Toril) to be judged. They all begin to chant, except for one female named Gibith, but she eventually joins in. Caiphon stretched and pinned down to Toril.

We suddenly returned to the temple. The skull speaks to us, saying he is Mimir and here to help us decide Caiphpon’s judgement.

                </P>

                <h1>Session 2</h1>
                <p>We long-rested at the temple and decided to head back to Mathieu. Went to the docks and met Sartell who runs the docks. Told her we’d help Mathieu with its bandit problem amongst other things.

                    We met Mayor Vanxath Loracys. We killed some bandits that came to town while meeting with her. We saw a Cleric/Preacher guy badmouthing Vanxath: Possible competitor. Arc also campaigned for mayorship ang got off to a “meh” start. We travelled into the forest to find the bandit hideout, but instead we found 3 Dragons in the Forest!
                    
                    Barrork attempted to talk to them, but was attacked. So we ran and they didn’t chase us. Maybe they're guarding something? Arc asked the nature around the area but they didn't know shit. We decided to go back to Mathieu.
                    </p>
                    
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Session 3</h1>
                <p>Just outside of Mathieu we robbed a potion maker who was leaving the town.
                <ul>
                        <li>2x Potion of Preservation</li>
                        <li>Potion of Arcana</li>
                        <li>Potion of Exp.</li>
                        <li>Potion of Darkvision</li>
                        <li>Potion of Anti-Paralyzation</li>
                        <li>Potion of Medicine</li>
                        <li>Potion of Nightmares</li>
                </ul>
                Right when we entered Mathieu there was the start of another attack on the city by bandits, but they seemed to have some help (Enforcers). We jumped in to fight. During the fight there were these dudes popping out of the corners and stealing our kills and talking shit. We think the attack was a set up by the Cleric/Preacher dude and the dudes stealing our kills were meant to make us look weak. We didn't kill all the Enforcers, since they fled, but left maybe 1 alive?
            </p>

                <h1>Session 4</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hypo Kryt gets applause from townsfolk. He worships Cyric - Trickster god.</li>
                    <li>Goblin girl has dirt on him - go to Wet Cat for more info.</li>
                    <li>Tavern - Efficient Fish </li>
                    <li>Wet Cat - Madam Levin. Tilra (missing girl) was the pastor's main girl. Feared Dead. </li>
                    <li>Checked Tilra’s room. Found love letters signed by H (Hypo Kryt)</li>
                    <li>Barrork & Arc went to the tavern and ran into Jyll & Corvum. Jyll is still scarred from her kidnapping. </li>
                    <li>Corvum proposed a bank heist opportunity to Barrork.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
             <li>
                <h1>Session 5</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Completed campfire story for Jerry</li>
                    <li>Ran into Parker Quinn who was trying to sell a charge card</li>
                    <li>Jerry forced Parker to drop the card and stole it from him.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
             <li>
                <h1>Session 6</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>We wrapped up my campfire story about slaughtering the orphanage. We continued on our way
                        to Baldur’s gate. We ran into a “salesman” selling credit cards. We used magic to have him
                        drop one of the cards.</li>
                    <li>We enter Baldur’s Gate. Protestors are active against tariffs at one tall walled building 
                        (Royal Palace). Lots of districts: market, entertainment, finance, etc… Flyers on 
                        bulletins: Battlemania!</li>
                    <li>Stopped at the Solid Snake inn. Got some drinks & made some money playing music. A book nerd 
                        named Illonis Smith told us of a legendary armor used when defeating 5 dragons that he’s 
                        researching (Gerald). There’s a cave in a town called “raven” that may have some of the armor.</li>
                    <li>Barrork thinks there’s correlation between the 5 dragons and the 3 we ran into. Compares it to a
                         legend from his homeworld. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Session 7</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>We joined the Battlemania and placed bets on ourselves and walked out promised 90,000 gold. </li>
                    <li>Vince gave us 6,000 gold up front and told us to go to the First Bank of Baldur’s Gate for the other 85,000.</li>
                    <li>We’re invited to the event in Neverwinter.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Session 8-11?</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>We were robbed by a teleporting bandit. </li>
                    <li>We also went shopping & I’m owed a Greataxe in 3 days. We were told of Dragon Scales from a leftover battle in Phandalin. 
                    <li>We questioned Vince to see if he had something to do with us getting robbed.</li>
                    <li>We decided to go to Phandalin and find these dragon scales. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
