            <h1>Love Letters from H</h1>

                <h2>Dated 4 months ago</h2>
                <p>Some of our most superb feelings and warm emotions come from our love. Our world, as we have come to see it, has no 
                    boundary when our lips lock together. No one can ever sever our bond of pure affection and intimate passion. We are 
                    the angels of our own personal heaven, where we have created our own language, too. It's no longer necessary for us 
                    to speak a language of words, for true love is clearly written in our eyes. It appears that you and I have fallen in 
                    love, without even having made an effort. This is our true heaven on earth, and we are the angels who dwell upon it. 
                    I love you, my Angel.<br></br>-H</p>

                <p>I can't really find the words to explain the way I feel when I hear your voice or when I see your face. All I can say
                     is that I love the feeling that I feel. Writing this is my way of telling you how much I truly love you.<br></br>-H</p>

                <h2>Dated 3 months ago</h2>
                <p>I was sleeping, yet my hand was searching for you, but you were not next to me. I turned my head and opened my eyes 
                    slightly to see you playing with your new bracelet, and I just smiled. As time went by, that would be so typical 
                    of me to do. I didn't know that you saw me sneaking glimpses of you. I turned my head to the other side and fell right
                    back to sleep. Within minutes, I felt you beside me, only the terry cotton of your robe between us. I cuddled right up
                    to you, like a puppy against his mother. I still wake up at times thinking of our first morning together when I smiled
                    and you saw me and read my mind. <br></br>-H</p>

                <h2>Dated 2 months ago</h2>
                <p>I know it is as difficult for you as it is for me to be separated for so long. Life seems to be full of trials of this
                     type that test our inner strength and, more importantly, our devotion and love for one another. After all, it is said
                      that true love is boundless and immeasurable and overcomes all forms of adversity. In truth, if love is genuine, it 
                      will grow stronger with each assault upon its existence. Our love has been assaulted many times, 
                      and I am convinced that it is true love because the longer I am away from you, the greater my yearning is to be with
                       you again. I cherish any thought of you, prize any memory of you that rises from 
                    the depths of my mind, and live for the day when our physical separation will no longer exist.
                    
                    Until that moment arrives, I send you my tender love, my warm embrace, and my most passionate kiss-across the miles. <br></br>-H</p>

                <p>My love, I have missed you so much in this time away. I am excited to hear the news you have for me. I shall return a few days before this letter 
                    reaches you my love. Meet me in our normal place. Meet me so I can embrace you. <br></br>-H</p>
