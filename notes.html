                <h1>Session 1</h1>
                <P>
                    I met Arc as he journeyed through the woods. We saw a ship crash in the distance and decided to check for survivors and/or threats.

There were dead Xaraxian guards & Barrork was fighting a Goliath. We decided to jump in and help. Arc turned into a fucking spider!

After the threat was eliminated we investigated a sphinx with a skull & book in its hands. It was rigged to kill anyone who tried to take the stuff with lightning damage, but we found a way using sticks to push it all off. We touched the stuff and we were transported to wildspace outside of Toril. We saw a group of people floating/standing over a person kneeling.

Barrork walked closer to the group to listen. Caiphon is the one kneeling. People around him are asking him to repent for something he’s done in order for power. Caiphon wanted mortals to worship him and the others as gods. They bind Caiphon to the mortal world (Toril) to be judged. They all begin to chant, except for one female named Gibith, but she eventually joins in. Caiphon stretched and pinned down to Toril.

We suddenly returned to the temple. The skull speaks to us, saying he is Mimir and here to help us decide Caiphpon’s judgement.

                <h1>Session 2</h1>
                <p>We long-rested at the temple and decided to head back to Mathieu. Went to the docks and met Sartell who runs the docks. Told her we’d help Mathieu with its bandit problem amongst other things.

                    We met Mayor Vanxath Loracys. We killed some bandits that came to town while meeting with her. We saw a Cleric/Preacher guy badmouthing Vanxath: Possible competitor. Arc also campaigned for mayorship ang got off to a “meh” start. We travelled into the forest to find the bandit hideout, but instead we found 3 Dragons in the Forest!
                    
                    Barrork attempted to talk to them, but was attacked. So we ran and they didn’t chase us. Maybe they're guarding something? Arc asked the nature around the area but they didn't know shit. We decided to go back to Mathieu.

                <h1>Session 3</h1>
                <p>Just outside of Mathieu we robbed a potion maker who was leaving the town.
                <ul>
                        <li>2x Potion of Preservation</li>
                        <li>Potion of Arcana</li>
                        <li>Potion of Exp.</li>
                        <li>Potion of Darkvision</li>
                        <li>Potion of Anti-Paralyzation</li>
                        <li>Potion of Medicine</li>
                        <li>Potion of Nightmares</li>
                </ul>
                Right when we entered Mathieu there was the start of another attack on the city by bandits, but they seemed to have some help (Enforcers). We jumped in to fight. During the fight there were these dudes popping out of the corners and stealing our kills and talking shit. We think the attack was a set up by the Cleric/Preacher dude and the dudes stealing our kills were meant to make us look weak. We didn't kill all the Enforcers, since they fled, but left maybe 1 alive?
