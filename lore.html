            The Xaraxyian Empire was formed after High Elfs began to explore Wild Space. It was here that high elfs slowly began to evolve into the astral elfs we know today. 
            These elves are slightly more racists than your average high elf, and believe themselves to be superior to all other races. This new species of Astral Elves discovered
            the planet Xaraxyia. It is on this planet the Astral Elves formed the Xaraxyian Empire. However, They learned quickly that their new planet had an issue. Its sun was beginning to
            lose fuel. Xaraxyia, having vast knowledge to the arcane, used their magics to restore the energy their Sun gave. This became known as the Light of Xaraxyia. Xaraxyian mages were able to
            prolong the lights strength for short periods of time, but they needed fuel. As the same time, more extreme astral elves that believed only their race had the right to exist within the
             Astral Plane. The Xaraxyian Empire then began to take a more extremeist view and began to conquer other planets to fuel the light as necessary. The Empire quickly spread throughout 
             the galaxy. However, their extremeist views eventually led to a rebellion. The first great Xaraxyian war began. Over time, the systems within the Torillian belt banded together to fight
            against the Xaraxyian Empire. After a long fought battle, the Torillian systems were able to push back the Empire. For centuries, a cease fire was held between the two factions. It wasn't 
            until the death of the Xaraxyian Emperor Xitler that the cease fire was broken. His son Xeleth began a renewed war against the Torillian systems. However, before the war could escalate
            further, brave heroes from the Torillian systems once again banded together to stop the Xaraxyian Empire. The once great empire is now a mere shadow of its former self. Now the Empire holds
            a small section on Toril. This region is protected by a barrier of mana that protects the region from a final attack by resistance forces. The Empire has resorted to guerilla warfare. They launch
            small scale attacks within Toril but have not been able to make any significant gains. The current Emperor, a non astral elf named Caiphon, has been leading Xaraxyia and has not shown 
            any signs of wanting peace.

            The Church of Brian Wright is a growing sect of the Church of Loki. Followers of Brian Wright believe that he is Loki's favorite son. They believe Loki sent Brian Wright to the mortal
            plane to save the souls of mortals. Little is known about the practices of the Church. They have begun to send it's followers out into the world to spread the word of Brian Wright. Recruiters
            of the faith have a scientific device known as a W-meter that registers a persons need to be saved. The Church has recruited a few thousand members and is slowly becoming a more mainstream
            religion.

        <p>
            Planet Gerald is apart of the Fitz system and guardians of the Torillian belt passage. Gerald gets its name from th legend of Gerald the Brave. It was said that Gerald held off an onslaught
            of three legendary dragons. The dragons not only threatened the planet Gerald, but the whole universe. Gerald's lone stand inspired those of what is now known as the the Torillian and 
            Xaraxyian systems to put aside their differences and fight together to vanquish the threat. This story lives on within every Geraldian. Forming their belief that it only takes one to accomplish
            the impossible. The Geraldian flag is of a lone man standing in defense against three dragons. After the first Xaraxyian war, the Geraldians took it upon themselves to guard the sole passage
            out of the Torillian system. However, as time went on, the Geraldians were left alone to guard the passage. Slowly the other planets of the Torillian system began to reduce its funding And
            resrources to the defense of the passage. When Xeleth decided it was time to reignite the war, the Geraldians were the first victims of the revamped Xaraxyian Empire. Geraldian's were quickly
            destroyed due to their lack of resources and manpower. Once their planet was secured, the Xaraxyians used Gerald's core to power the Light of Xaraxyia.
